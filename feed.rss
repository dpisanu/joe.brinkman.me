			<title>The Accidental Geek: A New Beginning</title>
			<link>http://joe.brinkman.me/posts/a%20new%20beginning</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In February 2003, I created a new website under the name "The Accidental Geek". This site was built using a new web application framework called IBuySpy Workshop and was a place where I could blog about my technology passions. I never intended to become a geek, but I fell in love with electronics as a young kid, and later moved into programming as computers became more accessible. The name seemed to fit: and the domain was available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In February 2003, I created a new website under the name &amp;quot;The Accidental Geek&amp;quot;. This site was built using a new web application framework called IBuySpy Workshop and was a place where I could blog about my technology passions. I never intended to become a geek, but I fell in love with electronics as a young kid, and later moved into programming as computers became more accessible. The name seemed to fit: and the domain was available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, IbuySpy Workshop became DotNetNuke, which later became DNN. When I started using IBuySpy Workshop, I immediately fell in love with the possibilities. Within just a couple months I quit my job and started a TAG Software, a development company focused on what was now called DotNetNuke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next two years, I spent all my spare time contibuting code to the DotNetNuke project, some of which is still in DNN today. I was never really able to get TAG off the ground as I got sucked back into my previous company to help launch a new J2EE dev environment.&lt;/p&gt;
